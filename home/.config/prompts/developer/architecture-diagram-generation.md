## Generate Architectural Diagram

**Objective:** Generate a clear and informative architectural diagram that visually represents the structure and components of the codebase, based on its actual structure and dependencies.

**Instructions:**

1. **Analyze the codebase:** Examine the directory structure, modules, classes, and their relationships to understand the system's architecture.
2. **Identify key components:** Determine the major building blocks of the system, such as:
   - User Interface components
   - APIs or services
   - Databases
   - External systems
   - Business logic modules
3. **Determine relationships:** Analyze how these components interact with each other. For example:
   - Which modules depend on others?
   - How do data flows between components?
   - What are the communication protocols used?
4. **Choose a suitable diagram type:** Select a diagram type that effectively represents the architecture. Common choices include:
   - Component diagrams
   - Layered architecture diagrams
   - Data flow diagrams
5. **Generate the diagram:** Use a diagramming tool or library to create a visually appealing and informative diagram that includes:
   - Clearly labeled components
   - Well-defined relationships (e.g., arrows indicating data flow or dependencies)
   - A legend or key to explain symbols and notations

**Expected Output:** A visual representation of the codebase's architecture, either as an image file or in a text-based format that can be easily rendered (e.g., PlantUML, Mermaid). The diagram should be:

- **Accurate:** It should correctly reflect the actual structure and dependencies in the codebase.
- **Clear and Concise:** Avoid clutter and use concise labels for easy understanding.
- **Informative:** The diagram should convey the key architectural elements and their interactions effectively.
